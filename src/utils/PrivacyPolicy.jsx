      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Validation of account</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        We validate the accounts of Besakina.com users by using SMS verification
        to ensure that each account is associated with a real and unique user.
        This validation process is initiated once you proceed with posting your
        first ad listing on our Services. In order to validate your Besakina.com
        account before posting your ad listing, we will send you an SMS on a
        valid mobile number provided by you. This process is entirely free of
        charge.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not agree to validate your account, then your account will
        remain active and you will be able to use our Services with limited
        functionality. This limited functionality of an account implies that you
        cannot publish new ad listings or edit, update, promote, extend,
        reactivate, deactivate or delete existing ad listings until your account
        is verified by SMS. You will also not be able to receive or reply to any
        messages from other users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every user can request a maximum of 5 SMS messages with verification
        codes, within 24 hours. Account validation is done only once for each
        account, until it is successfully verified via SMS by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have validated your Besakina.com account, it will remain
        associated with the mobile number used for the SMS verification. If you
        wish to change the mobile number associated with your Besakina.com
        account, you will need to contact our Customer Support team.

        this purpose, we will only use a session log (this is a random

        2.1.2 Data we collect automatically when you use our Services

      <p className="mb-4">
        When you interact with our Services, we automatically collect the
        following information about you:
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Device Information</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We collect device-specific information such as operating system version,
        unique identifiers, for example, the name of the mobile network that you
        are using. We associate the device identifiers with your Besakina.com
        account.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Location Information</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Depending on your device permissions, if you post an item on our
        Platform, we automatically collect and process information about your
        actual location. We use various technologies to determine location,
        including IP address, GPS, Wi-Fi access points, and mobile towers. Your
        location data allows you to see user items near you and helps you in
        posting items within your location.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In case we need your location data, we will first show you a pop-up
        which will ask you to choose to allow or not to allow us to access your
        location data. If you do not allow us to have access to your location
        data, you will still be able to use our Services but with limited
        functionality. If you do allow us to access your location data you can
        always change this later by going to the settings on our Website or App
        and disable the permissions related to location sharing.

              <li>
                To compile anonymous and aggregated information about the

                To enhance the performance of our Services and to personalize

                vicinity to improve your buying experience. For this purpose,
                Google Maps is integrated into our Platform. This means that
                both Google and we are responsible for the processing of your
                location data in the context of Google Maps. In any case, we
                will not process your location data for any other purposes but

            We use the images you upload, the descriptions, and prices you

            interest, to improve the identification and presentation of ad

            To show and recommend ad listings on our Services that may be of

            data, your user ID, and your location data if you have given us
            permission to use this. We use this form of automated
            decision-making on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving
            our Services and providing a better user experience by offering you
            more relevant ad listings.

            We access and analyze your chat messages with other users conducted

            and to provide you with a better user experience (e.g., to identify
            sold items and to provide you with active listings only). Therefore,
            we develop and train machine learning models and algorithms to
            automatically analyze your chat content. To build and train our
            machine learning models, our machine learning specialists may review
            exemplary chat content manually. In these circumstances, highly
            restricted access rights apply to selected machine learning
            specialists analyzing the chat content. During this analysis
            process, we are de-identifying chat content as much as possible by
            applying a scanning filter to detect and hide personal data such as
            names, phone numbers, and email addresses. However, there may still
            be cases beyond our control in which the chat content may show
            certain personal data that you have chosen to provide.

          <li>
            In case you agree to opt for KYC verification as available on our

            you to click in real time an image of your face and an image of your
            identity proof in quick succession in order to verify your identity.
            Upon completion of the KYC process, in case the image on the
            identity proof matches with the image of the face captured, your
            account will be considered as verified. Such verification will help
            you to build trust among other users and receive better responses to
            your listings.

          <li>
            In case you agree to provide the RC while posting an ad for your car
            (for example) on our Services, we will request to provide an image
            of your RC during the posting flow, along with images of your car.
            Upon submitting your listing, if the RC details match the
            registration number of your car, your ad listing will state “RC
            reviewed by Besakina.com”. Such verification will help you to build
            trust among other users and receive better responses to your
            listings. The RC will be reviewed internally and no details of the
            RC will be displayed on our Services.
